/*
The class ReentrantLock is a mutual exclusion lock with the same basic behavior as the implicit monitors accessed via the synchronized keyword
but with extended capabilities. As the name suggests this lock implements reentrant characteristics just as implicit monitors.

The method tryLock() as an alternative to lock() tries to acquire the lock without pausing the current thread.
The boolean result must be used to check if the lock has actually been acquired before accessing any shared mutable variables.

        1. Instead of sharing a lock, they provide different locks to each thread.
        This often happens to them unknowingly because they usually put the lock and guarded block inside Runnable,
        and they pass two different instances of Runnable to two different threads like where SimpleLock is a Runnable.
        Since here myLock is an instance variable, each instance of SimpleLock has its own myLock instance,
        which means firstThread and secondThread are using different locks and they can run protected code simultaneously.
