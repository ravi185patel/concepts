ReentrantLock behaves like synchronized and you might wonder when it's appropriate to use one or the other.
Use ReentrantLock when you need timed or interruptible lock waits, non-block-structured locks
(obtain a lock in one method; return the lock in another),  multiple condition variables, or lock polling.
Furthermore, ReentrantLock supports scalability and is useful where there is high contention among threads.
If none of these factors come into play, use synchronized.
